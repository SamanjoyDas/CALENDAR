IN THIS PROJECT MODULE WE WILL BE CREATING A CALENDAR MODULE. THE STEPS TO CREATE THE MODULE IS AS FOLLOWS :-
1) OPEN VS CODE.
2) COPY THE EXACT SAME HTML FILE, CSS FILE AND JAVASCRIPT FILE.
3) SAVE AND CLICK ON THE GO LIVE EXTENSION ON THE BOTTOM RIGHT CORNER OF THE SCREEN.

A NEW BROWSER WINDOW WITH OUR DESIRED OUTPUT WILL APPEAR. ENJOY!
